Most of the great changes that have taken place in the fine cafe world over the past eighteen years have been reflected in and often anticipated by our thousands of reviews and over two-hundred tasting reports and major articles.
		Our goal at CafeHolics Review is to entertain and educate coffee and various beverage drinkers, food service professionals, and the cafe trade with a credible and easy-to-use cafe guide based on objective, blind reviews from and other experienced individuals in the specialty and elegant cafe industry. </p>
